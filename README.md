# resume
My resume built using PHP and the FPDF library

## Setting up fpdf
A composer.json is included to make setting up the dependencies quick and easy.

## Setting up fonts
To set up the font's you will need to follow the guide here: http://www.fpdf.org/
You need to store the font in your fpdf's font directory. 
When using the makeFont use the .ttf files provided.

## Images
I have not provided my image here, if you wish to compile this you will need to create the following file
/include/images/profile.jpg

## Once setup is complete
Simply navigate to your folder and run the following command in your console:
php initiate.php
